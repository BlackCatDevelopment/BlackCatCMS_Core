Black Cat CMS Installation
==========================

# Technical requirements

* Minimum of 20 MB webspace (extended installations need more)
* PHP 5.3.x or higher
* MySQL 5.0 or higher
* Working PHP sessions
* Safe mode turned OFF
* For the Backend: A session, cookies and Javascript enabled admin browser

Black Cat CMS should work on any operating system and is tested with Apache 2.x
webserver only. It may work on other webserver types, too, but we do not support
this.

Storage space required is very dependent upon the modules, files (including
images and template graphics), and data you add to your site.


# Upload files

First, make sure that you have downloaded the latest stable release from
http://blackcat-cms.org

Unzip/untar the ZIP file with an Unzip software of your choice (for example,
7Zip for Windows users) to a directory somewhere on your computer and remember
where you saved it. You will get the following directory structure:

    /upload  (folder)
    /INSTALL (this file)
    /LICENSE
    /COPYING

Black Cat CMS may be installed directly into the www-root of your webspace, or
create a subdirectory called whatever you choose. For the purposes of this
tutorial, create a new sub-directory, for example, 'blackcatcms'.

With your FTP program, upload all files located in the `upload` folder into the
directory you chose to use in the previous step. You may upload the folder
itself, too, but that is not necessary and may result in an URL like
http://www.yourdomain.com/upload


# Create database

If possible, create an empty database. Depending on your host you may use a
program like PHPMyAdmin, or your hosts control panel.

You may use an existing database if you're not able (or don't wish to) create
a new, empty one. Black Cat CMS uses a custom table name prefix ('cat_' by
default) to separate it's tables from existing ones. Just make sure that you
don't have any existing tables with the same prefix. You can change the default
prefix in the installation process.

You need to have your database credentials ready for the next step.


# Installation Wizard

After the upload finished and the database is in place, go to your website
(type your domain name into your web browser). You should now see the Black
Cat CMS Installation Wizard page, which will guide you through the installation
process.

## Step 0 - Welcome page

## Step 1 - Pre installation checks

The Installation Wizard will now check if all prerequisites are met. If you see
any red crosses, you will have to fix this first before you can proceed.

## Step 2 - Global settings

Allows to set default language and timezone. In most cases, you will just
accept the defaults the installer suggests.

## Step 3 - Database settings

In this screen, you will have to put the database connection details, like
database host name, user name, and password.

## Step 4 - Site settings

Set your site name, admin name and password. You can change these settings later
if you wish.

## Step 5 - Postcheck

Before the actual installation starts, review the settings you made in the
previous steps. You can go back to every single step to make corrections if you
need to.

## Step 6 - Finished!
