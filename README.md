Black Cat CMS is based on LEPTON v2.0 Alpha, as released in May 2012. (See http://www.lepton-cms.org) 
After the key developers left the LEPTON Project in May 2012, there seemed to be no more development 
concerning that version, so we decided to take and finish our work. So, Black Cat CMS is what is called a "fork".

The name "BlackCat" is derived from the forum names of the founders: creative<strong>cat</strong> and <strong>Black</strong>Bird.
