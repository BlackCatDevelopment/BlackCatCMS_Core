Hello {$LOGIN_DISPLAY_NAME},

This mail was sent because the 'forgot password' function has been applied to your account.

Your new '{$LOGIN_WEBSITE_TITLE}' login details are:

Username: {$LOGIN_NAME}
Password: {$LOGIN_PASSWORD}

Your password has been reset to the one above.
This means that your old password will no longer work anymore!
If you've got any questions or problems within the new login-data
you should contact the website-team or the admin of '{$LOGIN_WEBSITE_TITLE}'.
Please remember to clean you browser-cache before using the new one to avoid unexpected fails.

Regards
